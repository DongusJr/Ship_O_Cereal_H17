                <p>This all started with just one friend-group that was adiment on trying all the best and newest cereal. In high school we were obsessed with cereals we just could not get enough of it we skipped most lunches just so we could have the best or newest cereal. But over time the group grew apart we found other interests and groups to hang out with. We still met upp on every wednesday just to have some good cereal. But when time came for universities we couldn't meet upp so easily so we started to send cereal to each other instead. Over time we had gotten good system for sending it to each other and even created a small craze in each of the universities. We started to notice the we weren't the only ones who enjoyed cereal so much. So a couple of us dropped out of university and we all founded this great company. In the beginnings we mostly targeted students but over time we grew into what you know today.    </p>
